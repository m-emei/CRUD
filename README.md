# Running JSON Server and Navigating to Data Folder

JSON Server is a simple and lightweight server that allows you to set up a REST API based on a JSON file. This is helpful for mocking APIs or quickly setting up a backend for development purposes.

## Installation

First, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can install JSON Server globally using npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```
1. Download the project or clone the project
2. Navigate to data
3. Run the following command via terminal or cmd
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

# Running a React Project

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If you have a React project that you want to run, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Before running the React project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the React project is hosted in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the Git repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate into the directory of your React project:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```
   Replace `project-name` with the name of your project directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm to install the project dependencies defined in the `package.json` file:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

Once you've set up the project, you can run it locally:

1. **Start the Development Server**: Use npm to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **View the Project**: Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the development server, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Commands

- **Build the Project**: To build the React project for production, use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This command creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

- **Run Tests**: If your project includes tests, you can run them using the following command:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  This command executes the test suite defined in the project.

That's it! You've now learned how to run a React project locally on your machine.
```

Feel free to customize the instructions based on your project's specific setup or requirements.
